This project is a replica of the DENSO BHT (Barcode Handy Terminal) scanner, designed to simulate the functionality of industrial handheld barcode scanning devices. It replicates the core features of a real BHT scanner, making it ideal for prototyping, testing, or educational use.

🔧 Features
Simulated barcode scanning (1D/2D)
Simple inventory/data entry system
Terminal-style user interface
Button/key input emulation
Data export (CSV/JSON)

💡 Use Cases
Warehouse/inventory system prototyping
Development without physical hardware
UI/UX design for handheld terminals
Educational demo for scanning workflows

🛠️ Tech Stack
Built using [Python with Tkinter], with support for barcode decoding using Pyzbar.
